# IDOC

iDoc is a comprehensive appointment scheduling platform designed for both patients and healthcare providers. It allows patients to easily search for and book appointments with doctors based on specialization, location, and availability. For healthcare providers, it offers a streamlined system to manage appointments and enhance communication with patients. iDoc is perfect for anyone looking to simplify the process of scheduling medical appointments and for clinics aiming to improve their service efficiency.
The idea for iDoc originated from our experiences with the inefficiencies of scheduling healthcare appointments, such as long waits, difficulty finding slots, and miscommunication. We created iDoc to address these issues and provide a more efficient, user-friendly solution.
